In this project, I used R and Quarto to explore R's diamonds dataset and understand both the individual variables and their relationships to one another. Having done that, I used K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to identify three clusters in the data before using traditional regression, random forests, and XGBoost to build regression models with an R^2 of ~98% that could predict diamond prices within $500 of the actual price.
